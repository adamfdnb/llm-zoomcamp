"A singular matrix error occurs during matrix inversion in the homework because not every matrix can be inverted. In particular, this error often arises due to the importance of the order of multiplication when using the method .dot. As matrix multiplication is not commutative, changing the order (e.g., X.dot(Y) vs. Y.dot(X)) can result in a different matrix, which may be singular and thus non-invertible. Therefore, it is essential to pay close attention to the multiplication order in your calculations.","I'm trying to invert the matrix but I got error that the matrix is singular matrix

"In the homework, X.dot(Y) is not necessarily equal to Y.dot(X) because matrix multiplication is not commutative.

2. **Inversion**: Be cautious when inverting matrices. If you've already inverted a matrix once in your code, avoid doing it a second time, as this can also lead to a singular matrix error.

This ensures that the backslashes are not interpreted as escape characters.","How do I read the dataset with Pandas in Windows?
I used the code below but not working
df = pd.read_csv('C:\Users\username\Downloads\data.csv')
Unlike Linux/Mac OS, Windows uses the backslash (\) to navigate the files that cause the conflict with Python. The problem with using the backslash is that in Python, the '\' has a purpose known as an escape sequence. Escape sequences allow us to include special characters in strings, for example, ""\n"" to add a new line or ""\t"" to add spaces, etc. To avoid the issue we just need to add ""r"" before the file path and Python will treat it as a literal string (not an escape sequence).
Here’s how we should be loading the file instead:
df = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\username\Downloads\data.csv')

"The imprecise results after matrix inversion are primarily due to the limitations of floating point arithmetic in computers. When you perform matrix inversion and then multiply the inverse by the original matrix, you might expect to get an identity matrix. However, you may end up with results like:

"The slight errors when multiplying an inverted matrix by the original are caused by floating point precision issues in computer arithmetic.

"Floating-point math affects the accuracy of matrix operations because it does not work well on computers, leading to small numerical errors. For example, when attempting to invert a matrix and multiply it back by the original matrix, the result may not be exactly the identity matrix due to these inaccuracies. This behavior is illustrated by the example where an inverse multiplied by the original matrix produces values that deviate slightly from expected results, such as `-1.38777878e-16` and `3.16968674e-13`, instead of strictly zero or one.","I was doing Question 7 from Week1 Homework and with step6: Invert XTX, I created the inverse.

This occurs because the presence of a few high-value observations skews the distribution, resulting in unequal areas on each side of the distribution. Consequently, the mean can be heavily influenced by these extreme values, leading to a larger range and unequal probabilities of observations on the left or right side of the distribution, making the mean a poor representative of the typical value in such cases.","One of the most important characteristics of the normal distribution is that mean=median=mode, this means that the most popular value, the mean of the distribution and 50% of the sample are under the same value, this is equivalent to say that the area under the curve (black) is the same on the left and on the right. The long tail (red curve) is the result of having a few observations with high values, now the behaviour of the distribution changes, first of all, the area is different on each side and now the mean, median and mode are different. As a consequence, the mean is no longer representative, the range is larger than before and the probability of being on the left or on the right is not the same.
(Tatiana Dávila)",94f928d2,Why is the mean no longer representative in a long tail distribution?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"One side of the long tail distribution has a different area because the distribution is characterized by a few observations with high values. This leads to changes in the behavior of the distribution, specifically resulting in unequal areas on each side. Additionally, the mean, median, and mode become different, causing the mean to no longer be representative of the data, and affecting the probability of being on the left or right side of the distribution.","One of the most important characteristics of the normal distribution is that mean=median=mode, this means that the most popular value, the mean of the distribution and 50% of the sample are under the same value, this is equivalent to say that the area under the curve (black) is the same on the left and on the right.

(Tatiana Dávila)",94f928d2,What causes one side of the long tail distribution to have a different area?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"High-value observations affect the distribution's range by increasing it. When there are a few observations with high values, the distribution becomes distorted, leading to differences in the area under the curve on each side. This results in the mean, median, and mode moving apart, meaning the range of the dataset is larger than before and the probability of observations being on the left or right of the mean is no longer equal.","One of the most important characteristics of the normal distribution is that mean=median=mode, this means that the most popular value, the mean of the distribution and 50% of the sample are under the same value, this is equivalent to say that the area under the curve (black) is the same on the left and on the right.

"To compute RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), you need the following libraries:

1. `numpy` (imported as `np`)
2. `sklearn.metrics` which includes the `mean_squared_error` function

Here's how you typically import them:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
```

You can calculate RMSE using the following code snippet:

```python
mse = mean_squared_error(actual_values, predicted_values)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
```","The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is one of the primary metrics to evaluate the performance of a regression model.

"To calculate RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries**:
   You will need `numpy` and `mean_squared_error` from `sklearn.metrics`.
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
   ```

2. **Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
   Use the `mean_squared_error` function to compute the MSE between your actual values and predicted values.
   ```python
   mse = mean_squared_error(actual_values, predicted_values)
   ```

3. **Compute the RMSE**:
   Take the square root of the MSE to get the RMSE.
   ```python
   rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
   print(""Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):"", rmse)
   ```

Alternatively, you can directly calculate RMSE without calculating MSE first by setting the `squared` argument to `False` in the `mean_squared_error` function:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_actual, y_predicted, squared=False)
```

This will give you the RMSE directly.","The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is one of the primary metrics to evaluate the performance of a regression model.

In this code, pd.get_dummies() creates a new DataFrame where the ‘brand’ column is replaced with binary columns for each brand (e.g., ‘brand_Nissan’, ‘brand_Toyota’, etc.). Each row in the DataFrame has a 1 in the column that corresponds to its brand and 0 in all other brand columns.

"Mutual information score is used only for categorical or discrete variables because it calculates the relationship between such variables. When the target variable, like median_house_value, is continuous, it must be transformed into a binary format to make its possible values discrete (e.g., either 0 or 1). If the continuous variable were left unchanged, calculating the mutual information score would require dividing it into bins, which can be subjective. Thus, continuous variables are not appropriate for this type of calculation.","Solution: Mutual Information score calculates the relationship between categorical variables or discrete variables. So in the homework, because the target which is median_house_value is continuous, we had to change it to binary format which in other words, makes its values discrete as either 0 or 1.

The correct way is to fit_transform the train set, and only transform the validation and test sets.
Memoona Tahira",b8da9037,How does the fit method of DictVectorizer handle categorical and numerical data?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"The correct way to use DictVectorizer on the train, validation, and test sets is to first fit the DictVectorizer on the training set using the `fit_transform` method. Subsequently, you should only use the `transform` method on the validation and test sets. This approach prevents data leakage and ensures that the validation and test sets are truly unseen data for the model, allowing for a proper evaluation of its performance. Avoid initializing another instance of DictVectorizer after fitting it on the training set, as doing so would overwrite what it learned from that dataset.","Validation dataset helps to validate models and prediction on unseen data.

Below is an extract of Alexey's book explaining this point. Hope is useful
When we apply the fit method, this method is looking at the content of the df_train dictionaries we are passing to the DictVectorizer instance, and fit is figuring out (training) how to map the values of these dictionaries. If categorical, applies one-hot encoding, if numerical it will leave it as it is.
With this context, if we apply the fit to the validation model, we are ""giving the answers"" and we are not letting the ""fit"" do its job for data that we haven't seen. By not applying the fit to the validation model we can know how well it was trained.

"The suggested technique for encoding categorical features for Ridge regression is to use OneHotEncoder (OHE). This method converts categorical variables into a numerical format by representing them as binary vectors, making them compatible with regression models like Ridge. Additionally, to avoid convergence issues, it is recommended to set sparse=True when applying one-hot encoding.","When encountering convergence errors during the training of a Ridge regression model, consider the following steps:
Feature Normalization: Normalize your numerical features using techniques like MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler. This ensures that numerical features are on a 	similar scale, preventing convergence issues.
Categorical Feature Encoding: If your dataset includes categorical features, apply 	categorical encoding techniques such as OneHotEncoder (OHE) to 	convert them into a numerical format. OHE is commonly used to represent categorical variables as binary vectors, making them compatible with regression models like Ridge.
Combine Features: After 	normalizing numerical features and encoding categorical features using OneHotEncoder, combine them to form a single feature matrix (X_train). This combined dataset serves as the input for training the Ridge regression model.
By following these steps, you can address convergence errors and enhance the stability of your Ridge model training process. It's important to note that the choice of encoding method, such as OneHotEncoder, is appropriate for handling categorical features in this context.

"The correct way to use `accuracy_score` in sklearn for classification evaluation is as follows:

   from sklearn import metrics
   ```

2. Calculate accuracy using the `accuracy_score` function:
   ```python
   accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred)
   ```

In cases where your predictions (`y_pred`) are probabilities (e.g., from a logistic regression model), you should first convert these probabilities to binary predictions by applying a threshold (e.g., `>= 0.5`), like this:
```python
accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(y_train, y_pred >= 0.5)
```

"Some classification tasks require setting the random_state parameter to ensure the ""randomness"" used to shuffle the dataset is reproducible. This is particularly relevant when using methods like train-test splits or cross-validation, where the random seed affects the way data is divided into training and validation sets. Without setting random_state, each run of the code may yield different results due to the random nature of the dataset splitting. Therefore, specifying random_state, along with the shuffle parameter, helps achieve consistent results across multiple runs.","Ie particularly in module-04 homework Qn2 vs Qn5. https://datatalks-club.slack.com/archives/C0288NJ5XSA/p1696760905214979

"To solve the ValueError related to having only 0's in the churn column, you need to ensure that your churn column contains both classes (0 and 1). The error occurs because the solver requires samples from at least 2 classes, but only 0's are present due to the way you are setting the churn values.

You can resolve this by ensuring that the churn values are correctly categorized. If you have a situation where the churn column is filled only with 0's, you can begin by verifying your data transformation step:

```python
df.churn = (df.churn == 'yes').astype(int)
```

This line converts the churn column based on whether the churn was marked as 'yes' or not, which may lead to only 0's if all original values were 'no' (non-churn). To include both classes, you need to check your dataset to ensure there are both 'yes' and 'no' values before applying this transformation.

(Arthur Minakhmetov)
Changing the random state makes a difference in my case too, but not whether it is inside or outside the for loop. I think I have got the answer. kFold = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle = True, random_state = 1)  is just a generator object and it contains only the information n_splits, shuffle and random_state. The k-fold splitting actually happens in the next for loop for train_idx, val_idx in kFold.split(df_full_train): . So it doesn't matter where we generate the object, before or after the first loop. It will generate the same information. But from the programming point of view, it is better to do it before the loop. No point doing it again and again inside the loop
(Bhaskar Sarma)
In case of KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=1) and C= [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10], it is better to loop through the different values of Cs as the video explained. I had separate train() and predict() functions, which were reused after dividing the dataset via KFold. The model ran about 10 minutes and provided a good score.

"The placement of KFold inside or outside the loop does not affect the results in HW04, Q6.

"Changing the `random_state` parameter in KFold affects the results because it alters the randomness involved in shuffling the dataset prior to splitting it into training and validation sets. When `shuffle=True` is set, different random states will generate different splits of the data, which could lead to variations in performance metrics when the model is trained and evaluated on these splits. A different random_state results in different pairs of datasets (train+val), which can influence the overall results observed during cross-validation.","What does this line do?

"The loop should iterate through the different C values as described in the video because each value of C represents a different level of regularization for the model. As explained, smaller C values introduce more regularization, which can lead to underfitting, while larger C values reduce regularization, which can lead to overfitting. By looping through these values, you can evaluate the model's performance for each level of regularization using cross-validation, and this allows you to select the best hyperparameter setting based on performance metrics. This evaluation is crucial for optimizing the model to achieve the best balance between bias and variance.","What does this line do?

"You can evaluate a model using scikit-learn metrics by calculating the following metrics:

1. **Accuracy**: Use `accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred)`.
2. **Precision**: Use `precision_score(y_val, y_pred)`.
3. **Recall**: Use `recall_score(y_val, y_pred)`.
4. **F1 Score**: Use `f1_score(y_val, y_pred)`.
5. **ROC AUC**: Use `roc_auc_score(y_val, y_pred)`.

Stratified k-fold is used for multiclass classification to maintain class balance when splitting the dataset. It ensures that each fold contains approximately the same percentage of samples from each class.,"For multiclass classification it is important to keep class balance when you split the data set. In this case Stratified k-fold returns folds that contains approximately the sme percentage of samples of each classes.

Olga Rudakova",927b5e09,What type of classification is Stratified k-fold used for?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"It is important to maintain class balance in multiclass classification because, when splitting the dataset for training and evaluation, stratified k-fold ensures that each fold contains approximately the same percentage of samples from each class. This helps in getting a more accurate and representative evaluation of the model's performance across all classes, thereby preventing potential biases that could arise from an imbalanced dataset.","For multiclass classification it is important to keep class balance when you split the data set.

3. Ensure that your system is able to virtualize in the BIOS settings, which is typically the case.

Make sure to follow these steps to activate the feature successfully.","It is quite simple, and you can follow these instructions here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYlgUDKKK5A&ab_channel=NeuralNine
Make sure that you have “Virtual Machine Platform” feature activated in your Windows “Features”. To do that, search “features” in the research bar and see if the checkbox is selected. You also need to make sure that your system (in the bios) is able to virtualize. This is usually the case.
In the Microsoft Store: look for ‘Ubuntu’ or ‘Debian’ (or any linux distribution you want) and install it
Once it is downloaded, open the app and choose a username and a password (secured one). When you type your password, nothing will show in the window, which is normal: the writing is invisible.
You are now inside of your linux system. You can test some commands such as “pwd”. You are not in your Windows system.
To go to your windows system: you need to go back two times with cd ../.. And then go to the “mnt” directory with cd mnt. If you list here your files, you will see your disks. You can move to the desired folder, for example here I moved to the ML_Zoomcamp folder:
Python should be already installed but you can check it by running sudo apt install python3 command.
You can make your actual folder your default folder when you open your Ubuntu terminal with this command : echo ""cd ../../mnt/your/folder/path"" >> ~/.bashrc
You can disable bell sounds (when you type something that does not exist for example) by modifying the inputrc file with this command: sudo vim /etc/inputrc
You have to uncomment the set bell-style none line -> to do that, press the “i” keyboard letter (for insert) and go with your keyboard to this line. Delete the # and then press the Escape keyboard touch and finally press “:wq” to write (it saves your modifications) then quit.
You can check that your modifications are taken into account by opening a new terminal (you can pin it to your task bar so you do not have to go to the Microsoft app each time).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYlgUDKKK5A&ab_channel=NeuralNine
Make sure that you have “Virtual Machine Platform” feature activated in your Windows “Features”. To do that, search “features” in the research bar and see if the checkbox is selected. You also need to make sure that your system (in the bios) is able to virtualize. This is usually the case.
In the Microsoft Store: look for ‘Ubuntu’ or ‘Debian’ (or any linux distribution you want) and install it
Once it is downloaded, open the app and choose a username and a password (secured one). When you type your password, nothing will show in the window, which is normal: the writing is invisible.
You are now inside of your linux system. You can test some commands such as “pwd”. You are not in your Windows system.
To go to your windows system: you need to go back two times with cd ../.. And then go to the “mnt” directory with cd mnt. If you list here your files, you will see your disks. You can move to the desired folder, for example here I moved to the ML_Zoomcamp folder:
Python should be already installed but you can check it by running sudo apt install python3 command.
You can make your actual folder your default folder when you open your Ubuntu terminal with this command : echo ""cd ../../mnt/your/folder/path"" >> ~/.bashrc
You can disable bell sounds (when you type something that does not exist for example) by modifying the inputrc file with this command: sudo vim /etc/inputrc
You have to uncomment the set bell-style none line -> to do that, press the “i” keyboard letter (for insert) and go with your keyboard to this line. Delete the # and then press the Escape keyboard touch and finally press “:wq” to write (it saves your modifications) then quit.
You can check that your modifications are taken into account by opening a new terminal (you can pin it to your task bar so you do not have to go to the Microsoft app each time).
You will need to install pip by running this command sudo apt install python3-pip

The version of sklearn used in the lecture by the facilitator was sklearn==0.24.1.,"When the facilitator was adding sklearn to the virtual environment in the lectures, he used sklearn==0.24.1 and it ran smoothly. But while doing the homework and you are asked to use the 1.0.2 version of sklearn, it gives errors.
The solution is to use the full name of sklearn. That is, run it as “pipenv install scikit-learn==1.0.2” and the error will go away, allowing you to install sklearn for the version in your virtual environment.

"Docker containers should be run with the `--rm` flag to automatically remove them upon exit, preventing the accumulation of stopped containers that take up disk space.

"Yes, the project folder's name impacts the environment's name. The environment name is derived from the name of the last folder in the folder directory where the `pipenv install` command (or any other pipenv command) is run.

"If you encounter library installation issues using pipenv, you should verify the following:

1. Check for any mismatch in your sub-dependencies. If you see an error message like `[pipenv.exceptions.ResolutionFailure]: Warning: Your dependencies could not be resolved`, try manually changing the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock.

2. Run the command `pipenv lock` to fix any issues with your dependency files.

3. If you receive an error stating that 'pipenv' is not recognized, ensure that pipenv is in your system's PATH by checking the relevant Python installation directories.

4. If you have trouble installing a specific package version, ensure you are using the full name of the package. For example, instead of `pipenv install sklearn==1.0.2`, you should use `pipenv install scikit-learn==1.0.2`.

3. **Build the Docker image**: Run the command to build your Docker image. If you want to replace any previously existing images, build without specifying a version so that it rebuilds and applies the latest tag.

4. **Run the Docker container with the `--rm` flag**: When running the container, use the `--rm` flag to automatically remove the container when it exits. This helps prevent the accumulation of stopped containers on your system.

   Example command:
   ```
   docker run --rm <image>

5. **Debug if necessary**: If you encounter issues, you can launch the container in interactive mode with a bash command by using:
   ```
   docker run -it --entrypoint bash <image>

Answer:
There are two options to fix this:
Re-initialize by running eb init -i and choosing the options from a list (the first default option for docker platform should be fine).
Edit the ‘.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml’ directly changing the default_platform from Docker to default_platform: Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2023

"In XGBoost, eta represents the learning rate of the model. It is a tunable hyperparameter that helps control the speed at which the model updates the minimum weights for the features during training. A smaller learning rate results in slower updates, allowing for more precise learning, while a larger learning rate can speed up the process but may risk overshooting the optimal weights.","Sometimes someone might wonder what eta means in the tunable hyperparameters of XGBoost and how it helps the model.
ETA is the learning rate of the model. XGBoost uses gradient descent to calculate and update the model. In gradient descent, we are looking for the minimum weights that help the model to learn the data very well.

"The eta parameter in XGBoost is the learning rate of the model. It influences how the model learns by controlling the speed at which it updates the weights during training. Specifically, a lower eta value makes the updates more gradual, which can contribute to better convergence and performance by allowing the model to learn the underlying data patterns more effectively. Tuning this learning rate is essential for optimizing the model's learning process with gradient descent.","Sometimes someone might wonder what eta means in the tunable hyperparameters of XGBoost and how it helps the model.

"In XGBoost, eta refers to the learning rate of the model. It plays a crucial role in the gradient descent process used by XGBoost to calculate and update the model. Essentially, the learning rate determines the speed at which the model updates the weights for the features during training. By tuning the learning rate (eta), you can influence how quickly or slowly the model approaches the optimal weights, which helps improve the model's ability to learn from the data effectively.","Sometimes someone might wonder what eta means in the tunable hyperparameters of XGBoost and how it helps the model.

"Bagging and boosting are two techniques used in ensemble algorithms. 

Bagging, short for ""Bootstrap Aggregation,"" involves creating multiple training datasets by sampling with replacement from the original dataset (bootstrapping). Multiple models (e.g., decision trees in Random Forests) are trained on these datasets independently and in parallel. The final prediction is made by aggregating the outputs, which can involve methods like voting for classification or averaging for regression. Bagging helps to decrease variance and is robust against overfitting.

Boosting, on the other hand, is a sequential approach where each model is trained based on the errors of the previous models. During this process, observations that were misclassified by earlier models are given higher weights, leading the subsequent models to focus more on correcting these errors. Boosting reduces bias and typically yields more accurate results than bagging, but it can be more prone to overfitting. 

In the course, examples of these techniques are demonstrated using Random Forest for bagging and XGBoost for boosting.","For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.
Random Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.
XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.
Note that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.

Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.

You get a 'continuous' label type error when using a DecisionTreeClassifier because you are likely using it to predict continuous values instead of discrete class labels.

"The AUC values change each time you re-run your DecisionTreeClassifier because the algorithm's behavior can be influenced by randomness.

"To plot feature importance using `sns.barplot`, you should set the following parameters:

- `x`: Set this to 'feature_importances', which corresponds to the column in the dataframe representing the importance values of the features.
- `y`: Set this to 'feature_names', which corresponds to the column in the dataframe representing the names of the features.
- `data`: Set this to the dataframe containing the feature importance data (`importance_df`).
- `palette`: Optionally, you can set this to a color palette; for example, 'Blues_r' is used in the provided context.

"To resolve the ""module scipy not found"" error in the Saturn Cloud TensorFlow image, you can do one of the following:

1. **Install scipy in your environment directly**: In a new cell in your Jupyter notebook, run the command:
   ```
   !pip install scipy
   ```
   After installing, remember to restart the kernel and then try fitting the model again.

2. **Install scipy during resource creation**: When creating your Jupyter server resource, in the “Extra Packages” section under pip, write `scipy` in the textbox. This will automatically install scipy when the resource spins up, preventing the error from occurring at runtime.

"When your model doesn’t improve accuracy and loss, there are a few possible issues to consider:

1. **Same Accuracy on Epochs**: The accuracy and loss remaining constant suggests that you might not be using the correct settings. You should check that you are using the correct `class_mode` (e.g., `class_mode='binary'`) while reading the data. Additionally, the wrong choice of optimizer, batch size, or learning rate could cause the model to stagnate.

2. **Model Breaking after Augmentation**: If accuracy settles around 0.5 and the loss skyrockets, this could indicate a problem with the data augmentation process. Specifically, ensure that the `ImageDataGenerator` includes the ""rescale"" option as specified previously. Failing to do this may lead to the model's performance being no better than random chance.

To resolve these issues, verify your data handling settings and experiment with different optimizers, batch sizes, or learning rates.","Problem description

"Yes, the folder name does determine the class in Keras when using the `flow_from_directory()` function. The name of the class is derived from the folder name, meaning that if you create a folder with any random name, it will be considered a class. Thus, the organization of images into folders is directly tied to the classification labels assigned by Keras.","Problem:

"If the accuracy and standard deviation of your model on your laptop are different from the HW answers, it may be due to various factors, such as the splitting method of the data or using different computing environments. 

One key reason could be the way you split the data. Different methods can result in variations in the training and testing datasets, leading to different accuracy results. It is recommended to follow a consistent splitting method as outlined in the homework materials.

Additionally, if you are using the SGD optimizer, running your code on different platforms (like Google Colab) may yield results that are closer to the expected answers. It can also be helpful to adjust the runtime settings on Colab to use T4, which may enhance performance and result consistency.

\[
(3 \times 3 \times 3 + 1) \times 32 = 896

"The output shape of a Conv2D layer is derived based on the formula for calculating the output dimensions after applying convolution. In the example provided, the Conv2D layer is defined with a kernel size of (3, 3), 32 filters, and an input shape of (150, 150, 3).

The output shape can be calculated as follows:
1. **Height and Width Calculation**: The output height and width are determined by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Output Size} = \left( \frac{\text{Input Size} - \text{Kernel Size} + 2 \times \text{Padding}}{\text{Stride}} \right) + 1
   \]
   Assuming padding is 0 and stride is 1, for both height and width:
   \[
   \text{Output Height} = \left( \frac{150 - 3 + 0}{1} \right) + 1 = 148
   \]
   \[
   \text{Output Width} = \left( \frac{150 - 3 + 0}{1} \right) + 1 = 148
   \]

2. **Depth Calculation**: The output depth (number of filters) is equal to the number of filters defined in the layer, which is 32.

Putting it all together, the output shape of the Conv2D layer is (None, 148, 148, 32), where ""None"" indicates the batch size.

"The Conv2d layer with 32 filters has 896 parameters because the calculation is as follows:

3 \text{ (height)} \times 3 \text{ (width)} \times 3 \text{ (channels)} + 1 \text{ (bias)} = 27 + 1 = 28

"The main difference between the Sequential and Functional Model API in Keras is their structure and complexity. The Sequential Model API is simpler and consists of a plain stack of layers where each layer has one input tensor and one output tensor, allowing you to start with an ""empty"" model and add layers in a sequential order. In contrast, the Functional Model API is more advanced and allows for complex architectures, such as specifying multiple inputs and outputs or reusing layers. This might be more beneficial in scenarios like Transfer Learning where you want to differentiate between the base model and additional layers.","It’s quite useful to understand that all types of models in the course are a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor (Sequential model TF page, Sequential class).
You can simply start from an “empty” model and add more and more layers in a sequential order.

"The Sequential Model API might be easier to use for beginners because it allows users to start from an “empty” model and add layers in a straightforward sequential order. This simplicity in building models, where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor, makes it more accessible for those new to deep learning. In contrast, the Functional Model API involves more complicated building processes with chained calls, which may be more challenging for beginners to grasp.","It’s quite useful to understand that all types of models in the course are a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor (Sequential model TF page, Sequential class).

"When correcting an error on a neural net architecture, you should consider the following steps: 

1. Ensure that the correct data preprocessing steps have been applied, such as feature normalization and categorical feature encoding, if applicable.
2. Check if the appropriate class mode is set while reading the data, particularly if dealing with binary classification (set `class_mode='binary'`).
3. Review the choice of optimizer, batch size, and learning rate, as selecting the wrong configurations can lead to convergence issues.

"Your lambda function may pass local tests but fail on a running Docker instance due to serialization issues with the response.

"The error when running the command `interpreter.set_tensor(input_index, x)` is caused by a mismatch in the expected data type. Specifically, it raises a `ValueError` indicating that it received a value of type `UINT8` while it was expecting a type of `FLOAT32` for the input. This typically happens when the variable `x` is of type `int` instead of the required `float`. 

To resolve this issue, you need to convert `x` to `float32` before calling `set_tensor`. You can do this by using the following code:

```python
x = np.float32(x)

"To create and push a Docker image for AWS Lambda, you need to follow these general steps:

1. **Build Your Docker Image**: Start by creating a Dockerfile that uses the base AWS Lambda image, for example, `FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10`.

2. **Build Locally**: You can build your Docker image using the command:
   ```
   docker build -t your-image-name .
   ```

3. **Test Locally**: Optionally, you can test the Docker image locally using the AWS RIE (runtime interface emulator) with the following command:
   ```
   docker run -it --rm -p 9000:8080 your-image-name
   ```
   This will start an endpoint locally at `http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations`.

4. **Authenticate and Push to ECR**: Before pushing the image to Amazon ECR, you need to authenticate your Docker client to your Amazon ECR registry using:
   ```
   aws ecr get-login-password --region region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
   ```
   Replace the placeholders with your actual AWS region and account ID.

5. **Tag Your Image**: Tag your Docker image for your ECR repository:
   ```
   docker tag your-image-name:latest aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/your-repo-name:tag
   ```

6. **Push Your Image**: Finally, push the image to ECR with:
   ```
   docker push aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/your-repo-name:tag
   ```

   pip install https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/raw/main/tflite/tflite_runtime-2.7.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
   ```

4. **Use TensorFlow**: If nothing else works, consider using the TFLite that comes with TensorFlow for local development.

5. **Virtual Machines**: You can run a virtual machine with a Linux system using a tool like VM VirtualBox, or utilize cloud services such as Vertex AI Workbench on GCP, which provides notebooks and terminals for your tasks.","Problem: When trying to install tflite_runtime with
!pip install --extra-index-url https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/ tflite_runtime
one gets an error message above.
Solution:
fflite_runtime is only available for the os-python version combinations that can be found here: https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/tflite-runtime/
your combination must be missing here
you can see if any of these work for you https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/tree/main/tflite
and install the needed one using pip
eg
pip install https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/raw/main/tflite/tflite_runtime-2.7.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
as it is done in the lectures code:
https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/blob/master/course-zoomcamp/09-serverless/code/Dockerfile#L4
Alternatively, use a virtual machine (with VM VirtualBox, for example) with a Linux system. The other way is to run a code at a virtual machine within cloud service, for example you can use Vertex AI Workbench at GCP (notebooks and terminals are provided there, so all tasks may be performed).

"To test AWS Lambda with Docker locally, you need to use AWS RIE (runtime interface emulator). Here are the steps to set it up:

1. Ensure your Docker image is based on the AWS Lambda image, using a command like `FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10`.
2. Run the image with the following command:
   ```
   docker run -it --rm -p 9000:8080 name
   ```
   This command will start an endpoint locally at `localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations`.

3. To test the function, you can use the following curl command:
   ```
   curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d '{}'
   ```

For specific examples, you can use the below commands based on your operating system:

- **Windows testing**:
  ```
  curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d ""{\""url\"": \""https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/d9/dh/rtd9dhsmhwrdezeldzoqgijdg8a.jpeg\""}""

"If you are unable to run `pip install tflite_runtime` from GitHub wheel links, you can try the following solutions:

1. Check the available OS-Python version combinations for `tflite_runtime` here: [https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/tflite-runtime/](https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/tflite-runtime/). If your combination is not listed, it means it is not supported.

2. If you can't find a matching version, you can explore the options available in this repository: [https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/tree/main/tflite](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/tree/main/tflite) and install an appropriate `.whl` file using pip, for example:

   pip install https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/raw/main/tflite/tflite_runtime-2.7.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
   ```

3. Alternatively, consider switching to a virtual machine with a Linux system, such as using VM VirtualBox, or you can utilize a cloud service like Vertex AI Workbench at GCP.

4. Lastly, if none of the above options work, you can use the TFLite included in TensorFlow for local development and utilize Docker for testing Lambda.","I’ve tried to do everything in Google Colab. Here is a way to work with Docker in Google Colab:

Solution: This error has something to do with versions of Flask and Werkzeug. I got the same error, if I just import flask with from flask import Flask.
By running pip freeze > requirements.txt,I found that their versions are Flask==2.2.2 and Werkzeug==2.2.2. This error appears while using an old version of werkzeug (2.2.2) with new version of flask (2.2.2). I solved it by pinning version of Flask into an older version with pipenv install Flask==2.1.3.

However, you need to derive the your hash value of your email address and find the value on the spreadsheet under the (reviewer_hash) heading.
To calculate your hash value run the python code below:
from hashlib import sha1
def compute_hash(email):
return sha1(email.lower().encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
# Example usage **** enter your email below (Example1@gmail.com)****
email = ""Example1@gmail.com""
hashed_email = compute_hash(email)
print(""Original Email:"", email)
print(""Hashed Email (SHA-1):"", hashed_email)
Edit the above code to replace Example1@gmail.com as your email address
Store and run the above python code from your terminal. See below as the Hashed Email (SHA-1) value
You then go to the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR-7RRtq7AMx5OzI-tDbkzsbxNLm-NvFOP5OfJmhCek9oYcDx5jzxtZW2ZqWvBqc395UZpHBv1of9R1/pubhtml?gid=876309294&single=true
Lastly, copy the “Hashed Email (SHA-1): bd9770be022dede87419068aa1acd7a2ab441675” value and search for 3 identical entries. There you should see your peer project to be reviewed.

This prevents extremely high values from disproportionately influencing statistical analyses and model performance.","There are different techniques, but the most common used are the next:
Dataset transformation (for example, log transformation)

"The cause of a long error message with something about sparse matrices and a code 500 error with an empty string output in BentoML could be due to setting DictVectorizer or One-Hot Encoding (OHE) to sparse while training. When this is stored in a pipeline or custom object during the model saving stage in train.py, it leads to inconsistent input sizes when the custom object is called in service.py. This results in each input being converted to differently sized sparse matrices, causing a failure to batch them. To rectify this issue, it is recommended to set the `batchable` parameter to False in the BentoML model signatures during the saving of the model in train.py.","You might see a long error message with something about sparse matrices, and in the swagger UI, you get a code 500 error with “” (empty string) as output.
Potential reason: Setting DictVectorizer or OHE to sparse while training, and then storing this in a pipeline or custom object in the benotml model saving stage in train.py. This means that when the custom object is called in service.py, it will convert each input to a different sized sparse matrix, and this can't be batched due to inconsistent length.

"To convert the `day_of_the_month` and `month_of_the_year` columns into a single `day_of_the_year` column in pandas, follow these steps:

1. Convert the `day_of_the_month` column from integer to string:
   ```python
   df['day_of_the_month'] = df['day_of_the_month'].map(str)
   ```

2. Convert the `month_of_the_year` column (which contains strings like 'jan', 'feb', etc.) into corresponding month numbers (as strings):
   ```python
   df['month'] = df['month_of_the_year'].map({'jan': '1', 'feb': '2', 'mar': '3', 'apr': '4', 'may': '5', 'jun': '6', 'jul': '7', 'aug': '8', 'sep': '9', 'oct': '10', 'nov': '11', 'dec': '12'})
   ```

3. Create a datetime object from the day and month:
   ```python
   df['date_formatted'] = pd.to_datetime(dict(year='2055', month=df['month'], day=df['day_of_the_month']))
   ```

4. Extract the day of the year from the datetime object:
   ```python
   df['day_of_year'] = df['date_formatted'].dt.dayofyear
   ```

"To transform month_of_the_year values like 'jan' and 'feb' into integers in pandas, you can use the `map()` function to convert the string representations of the months into corresponding integers. Here's a step-by-step approach based on your context:

1. First, convert the `month_of_the_year` values (like 'jan', 'feb', etc.) into integer strings (1 for 'jan', 2 for 'feb', ..., 12 for 'dec') using the `map()` method.

2. Then, you can create a new DataFrame column that represents the day of the year by converting both the day and the month into a datetime object using `pd.to_datetime()`.

Here is a condensed example of how you can achieve this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'day_of_the_month': [1, 2, 2, 28],
    'month_of_the_year': ['jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'dec']
})

# Map month names to their respective integer values
month_map = {'jan': 1, 'feb': 2, 'mar': 3, 'apr': 4, 
             'may': 5, 'jun': 6, 'jul': 7, 'aug': 8, 
             'sep': 9, 'oct': 10, 'nov': 11, 'dec': 12}

df['month'] = df['month_of_the_year'].map(month_map)

# Convert day and month to datetime and get day of the year
df['date_formatted'] = pd.to_datetime(
    dict(year='2055', month=df['month'], day=df['day_of_the_month'])
)
df['day_of_year'] = df['date_formatted'].dt.dayofyear

# The result will give you the transformed values
print(df[['day_of_the_month', 'month_of_the_year', 'day_of_year']])
```

This code will provide you with the `day_of_year` for corresponding `day_of_the_month` and `month_of_the_year` values as integers.","Problem description: I have one column day_of_the_month .

"The order is important in matrix multiplication because changing the order of the matrices can result in matrices of different sizes and usually different values. For instance, multiplying matrix A (with dimensions m x n) by matrix B (with dimensions n x p) yields a matrix C (of dimensions m x p). However, if the multiplication is reversed and you multiply B by A, you get a different matrix D (of dimensions n x n). Therefore, the order of multiplication affects both the size and the outcome of the result.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.
For example:
A (m x n) * B (n x p) = C (m x p)
B (n x p) * A (m x n) = D (n x n)

Baran Akın",59b4324f,Why is the order important in matrix multiplication?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"When you change the order in matrix multiplication, the result is typically different. The multiplication of matrices is not commutative, meaning that A (m x n) * B (n x p) will produce a matrix C (m x p), whereas B (n x p) * A (m x n) will result in a different matrix D (n x n). C and D are matrices of different sizes and usually have different values, highlighting the importance of the order in which matrices are multiplied.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.

Baran Akın",59b4324f,How does the size of the resulting matrix change with the order of multiplication?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"No, multiplying matrices in a different order cannot produce the same result. The order of multiplication is important in matrix operations, and changing the order will result in different matrices, often of different sizes.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.

Baran Akın",59b4324f,Can multiplying matrices in a different order produce the same result?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"An example that illustrates the impact of changing the order in matrix multiplication is as follows:

Consider two matrices A and B:
- Matrix A is of size (m x n)
- Matrix B is of size (n x p)

When you multiply them in the order A * B, the resulting matrix C will have a size of (m x p). 

However, if you change the order and multiply B * A, the resulting matrix D will have a different size of (n x n). 

Since C and D are matrices of different sizes, they usually contain different values as well. This demonstrates that the order of multiplication is crucial in matrix multiplication, and changing the order changes both the size and the result of the multiplication.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.

"No, it is not necessarily best to train your model only on the most important features. While some features may offer more predictive value, any feature that can contribute additional predictive value should be included. It's advisable to predict with and without including certain features and to assess their impact on model performance. If excluding a feature results in a drop in performance, it should be retained; otherwise, it can be dropped.","I’m just looking back at the lessons in week 3 (churn prediction project), and lesson 3.6 talks about Feature Importance for categorical values. At 8.12, the mutual info scores show that the some features are more important than others, but then in lesson 3.10 the Logistic Regression model is trained on all of the categorical variables (see 1:35). Once we have done feature importance, is it best to train your model only on the most important features?
Not necessarily - rather, any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included (so, e.g. predict with & without including that feature; if excluding it drops performance, keep it, else drop it). A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine. There are many feature selection algorithms, it might be interesting to read up on them (among the methods we've learned so far in this course, L1 regularization (Lasso) implicitly does feature selection by shrinking some weights all the way to zero).

"Yes, features that contribute minimally to performance can be excluded, but it's not a strict rule. After conducting feature importance analysis, if a feature does not provide additional predictive value (i.e., excluding it does not drop performance), it can be dropped.

Sampling: In the exploratory phase, you can use random samples of the data.
Chunking: When you do need all the data, you can read and process it in chunks that do fit in the memory.
Optimizing data types: Pandas’ automatic data type inference (when reading data in) might result in e.g. float64 precision being used to represent integers, which wastes space. You might achieve substantial memory reduction by optimizing the data types.
